title: From Big-O to lim sup
---

Let's start with the definition of big-O.

$$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if there exist positive constants $$c$$ and $$N$$, such that for all $$n \geq N$$, \\[f(n) \leq cg(n)\\]. Contrast this with the definition of little-o.

$$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if for all $$c > 0$$, there exist $$N$$, such that for all $$n \geq N$$, \\[f(n) \leq cg(n)\\].
