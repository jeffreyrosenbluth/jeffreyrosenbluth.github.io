title: From Big-O to lim sup
---

Let's start with the definition of big-O,

$$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if there exist positive constants $$c$$ and $$N$$, such that for all $$n \geq N$$, \\[f(n) \leq cg(n)\\] Contrast this with the definition of little-o,

$$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if for all $$c > 0$$, there exist $$N$$, such that for all $$n \geq N$$, \\[f(n) \leq cg(n)\\]

*Note that in the definition of little-o $$N$$ may depend on $$c$$.*
An equivalent definition of little-o is,

$$f(n)$$ is $$o(g(n))$$ if
\\[lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} < \\infty\\]
