title: From Big-O to lim sup
---
The definition is *little-o* is often described in terms of taking a limit and checking is it is equal to zero. On the other hand, the definition of *big-O* is usually expressed in terms of the existence or certain positive constants satisfying an inequality. The limit definition for *little-o* is very useful and it would be nice if we had a similar definition for *big-O*. Let's see what the issues are here. Let's start with the definition of *big-O*,

$$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if there exist positive constants $$c$$ and $$N$$, such that for all $$n \geq N$$, \\[f(n) \leq cg(n)\\] Contrast this with the definition of *little-o*,

$$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if for all $$c > 0$$, there exist $$N$$, such that for all $$n \geq N$$, \\[f(n) \leq cg(n)\\]

*Note that in the definition of *little-o*, $$N$$ may depend on the choice of $$c$$.*
An equivalent definition of *little-o* is,

$$f(n)$$ is $$o(g(n))$$ if
{% raw %}
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0
$$
{% endraw %}

This is the definition most often used for checking if $$f(n)$$ is $$o(g(n))$$, since we can apply the tools of calculus to calculate the limit instead of trying to find an $$N$$ for each $$c$$. Do we have a similar definition of *big-O*? It may seem at first that the following definition is equivalent to the above definition for *big-O*,

$$f(n)$$ is $$O(g(n))$$ if,
{% raw %}
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} < \infty
$$
{% endraw %}

The problem is that the limit is not guaranteed to exist. This was not a problem in our definition of *little-o*, since if the limit is equal $$0$$ it must exit. Here is an example of where the limit does not exit. Take $$f(n)$$ to be the function on the integers $$\{0,1, \ldots\}$$ such that $$f(n)=0$$ if $$n$$ is even and $$f(n)=1$$ if $$n$$ is odd, and let $$g(n)=1$$. Then the limit as $$n \rightarrow \infty$$ of $$f(n)/g(n)$$ does not exist, the value of $$f(n)/g(n)$$ oscillates between $$0$$ and $$1$$ forever. On the other hand $$f(n)$$ is clearly $$O(g(n))$$, since
{% raw %}
$$f(n) \leq g(n) \text{ for all } n \geq 0$$
{% endraw %}

This tells us that if the definition of *big-O* is satisfied it may not be the case that the above limit exists. What about the other direction, i.e. if the limit exists and is finite, does this imply *big-O*, after all, we are usually trying to prove that some function is *big-O* of some other function. Let's see, if the limit is finite it must be equal to some constant $$c$$ so we have,
{% raw %}
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \leq c
\text{This means that there must be a $$c$$ and an $$N$$ such that, for all $$n$$ \geq $$N$$}
\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \leq c
\text{that is}
f(n) \leq cg(n)
$$
{% endraw %}
